Graphics Processing Units (GPU) offer tremendous computational power by following a throughput oriented paradigm where many thousand computational units operate in parallel.
Programming such massively parallel hardware is challenging.
Programmers must correctly and efficiently coordinate thousands of threads and their accesses to various shared memory spaces.
Existing mainstream GPU programming languages, such as CUDA and OpenCL, are based on C/C++ inheriting their fundamentally unsafe ways to access memory via raw pointers.
This facilitates easy to make, but hard to detect bugs, such as _data races_ and _deadlocks_.

In this paper, we present #Descend: a safe GPU programming language.
In contrast to prior safe high-level GPU programming approaches, #Descend is an imperative GPU _systems programming language_ in the spirit of Rust, enforcing safe CPU and GPU memory management in the type system by tracking _Ownership_ and _Lifetimes_.
#Descend introduces a new _holistic GPU programming_ model where computations are hierarchically scheduled over the GPU's _execution resources_: grid, blocks, warps, and threads.
#Descend's extended _Borrow_ checking ensures that execution resources safely access memory regions without data races.
For this, we introduced _views_ describing safe parallel access patterns of memory regions, as well as _atomic_ variables.
For memory accesses that can't be checked by our type system, users can annotate limited code sections as `unsafe`.

We discuss the memory safety guarantees offered by #Descend and evaluate our implementation using multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that #Descend is capable of expressing real-world GPU programs showing competitive performance compared to manually written CUDA programs lacking #Descend's safety guarantees.

= Introduction
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are massively parallel hardware devices with a throughput oriented design that prioritizes the runtime of the overall computation performed in parallel by thousands of collaborating threads over single thread performance, as classical CPUs do #cite(label("DBLP:journals/cacm/GarlandK10")).
This has made GPUs attractive devices in many domains where high performance is crucial, such as in scientific simulations, medical imaging, and most prominently, machine learning.

Writing correct and efficient software for GPUs is challenging even for advanced programmers.
The predominant languages for general purpose GPU programming, CUDA and OpenCL, are low-level imperative _systems programming languages_, giving programmers great control to precisely influence how each thread accesses memory and when it performs which computational instructions.
This control is needed to extract the expected high performance from GPUs, where the difference between an unoptimized naive implementation and a fully optimized implementation can be up to two orders of magnitude #cite(label("10.1145/3570638"))--- often significantly more than on CPUs.

Unfortunately, in CUDA and OpenCL, this level of control comes with significant challenges for GPU programmers.
As both languages are based on C/C++ they inherit their fundamentally unsafe ways to access memory via raw pointers.
Furthermore, to coordinate threads and ensure a consistent view of the memory, manual synchronization primitives must be used correctly.
This leads to easy-to-make, but often hard to detect bugs, particularly race conditions when accessing the same memory from multiple threads and deadlocks when using synchronization incorrectly.

caption: [A CUDA matrix transposition GPU kernel. A subtle indexing bug in line 4 leads to a data race.],
cudaCode(```cpp
__global__ void transpose(const double *input, double *output) {
    __shared__ float tmp[1024];
    for (int j = 0; j < 32; j += 8) {
        tmp[threadIdx.y+j *32+threadIdx.x] =
            input[(blockIdx.y*32+threadIdx.y+j)*2048 + blockIdx.x*32+threadIdx.x]; }
    __syncthreads();
    for (int j = 0; j < 32; j += 8) {
        output[(blockIdx.x*32+threadIdx.y+j)*2048 + blockIdx.y*32+threadIdx.x] =
            tmp[threadIdx.x*32+threadIdx.y+j]; } }
```)) <lst:cuda-transpose-example>

@lst:cuda-transpose-example shows a CUDA kernel function, executed in parallel on the GPU to transpose a matrix.
In lines 4--5, each thread copies four matrix elements into a buffer and then---after a synchronization---copies the transposed elements to the output.
The correctness of this function depends on correct indexing which is notoriously tricky.
In fact, @lst:cuda-transpose-example contains a subtle bug:
In line 4, `threadIdx.y+j` should be enclosed by parenthesis, so that both terms are multiplied by 32.
As a result, a data race occurs as multiple threads will write uncoordinated into the same memory location.

Rust has demonstrated that a systems programming language can be designed in a memory safe way without losing low-level control.
It prevents data races, by forbidding the concurrent access of threads to a memory resource if at least one thread is allowed to mutate it #cite(label("DBLP:journals/cacm/JungJKD21")).
Rust enforces this with its type system, specifically with _borrow_ checking, that interacts with the concepts of _ownership_ and _lifetimes_ which primarily ensure safe memory management.
Could Rust have prevented the bug in @lst:cuda-transpose-example?
Clearly, `tmp` is shared among the parallel executing threads and, clearly, we mutate its content in line 5.
Therefore, Rust would reject this kernel, without even attempting to investigate if the indexing is safe, as Rust's type system has no capabilities of reasoning about safely accessing an array in parallel by multiple threads.

In this paper, we introduce #Descend, a safe GPU programming language adapting and extending the ideas of Rust towards GPU systems.
In contrast to prior safe GPU programming approaches, such as Futhark #cite(label("DBLP:conf/pldi/HenriksenSEHO17")), #Descend is an imperative systems programming language empowering programmers to exercise low-level control with a safety net.

@lst:descend-transpose-example shows the matrix transposition function in #Descend.
In contrast to CUDA, this function is not implicitly executed by thousands of GPU threads, instead this function is executed by the (_one_) GPU grid.
Programmers describe the hierarchical scheduling of the computation over the _grid_, first by describing the scheduling of _blocks_ (line~4) and then the nested _threads_ (line~5).
Each `block` has access to its own shared memory that is passed into the function in line~2.
Each `thread` performs the same copies as in CUDA, first from the input into the temporary buffer, and then---after a synchronization--- back into the output.
Instead of raw indexing, in #Descend programmers use memory _views_ to describe parallel accesses into memory.
#Descend statically ensures that accesses into views are safe, and treats them specially in the type system.
This restricts memory accesses to safe parallel access patterns.
Compositions of views allow for describing complex memory accesses.
For the example, the borrow checking of #Descend is capable to statically determine that the parallel write access into the shared temporary buffer and the output are safe.
Similarly, #Descend statically enforces the correct use of the synchronization, that cannot be forgotten or placed incorrectly.

descendCode(```rust
fn transpose(input:  &gpu.global [[f64;2048];2048], output: &uniq gpu.global [[f64;2048];2048],
             [grid.blocks.forall(X).forall(Y)] tmp: &uniq gpu.shared [[f64;32];32]

      sync(block);

          tmp.group_by_row::<32,4>[[thread]][i] } } } }
```)) <lst:descend-transpose-example>

#Descend is a holistic programming language for heterogeneous systems comprised of CPU and GPU.
The physically separated memories of CPU and GPU are reflected in the types of references for which #Descend enforces that they are only dereferenced in the correct execution context.
Functions are annotated with an _execution resource_ (as seen in the function signature in line~3) indicating how a function is executed.
These annotations make important assumptions, that are implicit in CUDA, about how many threads and blocks execute a kernel, explicit and enforceable by the type system.

With #Descend, we explore one new point in the design space of GPU programming languages, aiming to uniquely combine the imperative nature and low-level control with the safety so-far only found in higher level GPU programming approaches.
As we will see in this paper, #Descend empowers programmers to safely control low-level details including memory layout and which thread accesses which memory location when.
This allows expressing GPU algorithms safely, that cannot be described natively by the user and are built-in in existing safe GPU approaches.

= Challenges of GPU Programming <sec:gpu-programming-difficult>

#text(spacing: 70%)[GPU programming brings a number of challenges, that we group in two areas:
_1)_ challenges from working with the execution and memory hierarchies of GPUs, such as thousands of threads grouped in blocks accessing various GPU memories; and
_2)_ challenges from coordinating the heterogeneous system, such as transferring data between CPU and GPU memory.
Before we discuss each area, we give a brief overview of the traditional GPU programming model established by CUDA.]

CUDA is a sophisticated programming language with many advanced features that have been added over years to keep pace with evolving hardware capabilities.
In this paper, we focus on a subset of the CUDA features to capture the core essence of CUDA and model it in #Descend.
Therefore, we focus our discussion in this section on these core features and point out significant advanced features of CUDA, that we hope we will be able to model with #Descend in the future.

== The CUDA GPU Programming Model
In CUDA, programmers write _kernel_ functions that are executed in parallel on the GPU.
These functions are executed by many thousands of threads, all executing the same code.
Therefore, on a first view, the CUDA programming model resembles traditional data-parallel programming models, where a single instruction is applied to multiple data elements in lock-step.
However, in CUDA this strict requirement is relaxed as code can branch based on the _thread index_ that identifies the individual thread.
It is usually used for indexing into arrays so that each thread processes a different array element.
Thread indices are integers used to index plain C-style arrays, making statically checking the safety of parallel memory accesses challenging and leading to data races being introduced easily.
Furthermore, kernels are often written with implicit assumptions about how many threads execute them, making kernels hard to understand without knowing these assumptions which are an additional source of bugs, when CPU and GPU code diverge over time.

GPUs are comprised of multiple Streaming Multiprocessors (SM), each capable of executing groupings of 32 parallel _threads_, called _warps_, simultaneously.
Threads are hierarchically organized into groups, that are executed independently by the SMs.
In CUDA, such groups of threads are called _blocks_.
The collection of all blocks is called the _grid_.

Similarly, memory is organized hierarchically as well and closely connected to the execution hierarchy.
In software, separate _address spaces_ reflect the different kinds of GPU memory.
The slowest and largest memory is _global memory_, which is accessible by each thread in the entire grid.
Each block provides the fast _shared memory_ which is accessible only by each thread in the block.
Lastly, each thread has exclusive access to its own and fastest _private memory_.
Data transferred from the host to the GPU is always stored in global memory.
In order to exploit the faster memories, data has to be copied explicitly between address spaces.

== Challenges of the Execution & Memory Hierarchies
The CUDA programming model with its execution and memory hierarchies, resembles closely the GPU hardware and enables scalability of GPU programs, but it comes with two major challenges:
how to avoid _data races_ and how to correctly _synchronize_ the threads of a block.

#paragraph[Data Races]
Data races occur when multiple threads simultaneously access the same memory location and at least one performs a write.
It is easy to create a data race in CUDA:
#cudaCode(```cpp
__global__ void rev_per_block(double *array) {
  double *block_part = &array[blockIdx.x * blockDim.x];
  block_part[threadIdx.x] = block_part[blockDim.x-1 - threadIdx.x]; }
```)

#parIndent In this example, that is inspired by a bug in a real-world kernel described by #cite(label("DBLP:conf/icse/WuOZZ0Z20")), the input `array` is split into independent parts for each block.
Then the threads in each block access a single element in the reverse order of their thread index and write the value back into the array at their thread index.
This creates a data race:
a thread may still be reading a value from an index that another thread is already writing to.
In #Descend, the compiler recognizes the possibility of a data race and would reject the program with an error message:
#descendCode(```rust
error: conflicting memory access
  | arr[[thread]] = arr.rev[[thread]];
  |                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^-------------------
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot select memory because of a conflicting prior selection here
```)
#v(1em)

#parIndent We will explain in @sec:descend, that for this check #Descend performs an extended _borrow (or access) checking_ similar to Rust, tracing which memory location (formalized as _place expressions_) is accessed by which thread (formalized as _execution resources_).
To make this check feasible, in #Descend parallel memory accesses are performed via _views_, which are safe parallel access patterns, such as `rev` for reverse in this example.
Views can be composed to enable complex parallel access patterns that are still known to be safe.

#paragraph[Synchronization]
To avoid data races, CUDA provides various forms of barriers.
Originally, CUDA provided only barriers for synchronizing threads within the same warp or block.
We will focus on modelling these barriers in this paper.
More recent versions of CUDA have added support for grid-wide and partial barriers and 
the underlying GPU supports even more sophisticated barriers, such as named and producer-consumer barriers #cite(label("DBLP:conf/ppopp/BauerTA14")).
To avoid undefined behavior, when using a barrier, each participating thread must reach that barrier.
Unfortunately, it is easy to violate this requirement, such as for this block-wide barrier:
#cudaCode(numbering: false, ```cpp
__global__ kernel(...) { if (threadIdx.x < 32) { __syncthreads() } }
```)
#v(1em)

#parIndent In this CUDA kernel, the `__syncthreads` barrier is executed only by threads that have an index smaller than $32$ within each block.
When launched with more than $32$ threads per block, the behavior of the program is undefined.
In #Descend, a program such as this would not compile, if there are more than $32$ threads per block, failing with an error message:
#descendCode(```rust
error: barrier not allowed here
  | first_32_threads => { sync }
  |                       ^^^^ `sync` not performed by all threads in the block ------
  |    split(X) block at 32 {
  |    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `block` is split here
```)
#v(1em)

#parIndent We will discuss in @sec:descend, how the compiler checks that synchronizations are performed correctly.
In #Descend, either all threads in a block perform the same instructions (when using the `sched` syntax seen before), or the threads in a block must be split using the syntax shown in the error message above.
A synchronization performed on a split block or a conditional is forbidden.
#Descend also ensures that synchronizations are not forgotten.
A synchronizations releases borrows of the synchronized memories which, if forgotten, are flagged by the borrow checker as seen above.

== Challenges of Heterogeneity
GPUs are not programmed only by writing kernels.
They are part of a heterogeneous system, with the CPU and GPU performing computations asynchronously and the CPU managing the computations on the GPU.
Two significant challenges arise from this:
the handling of the physically _separated memories_ on CPU and GPU,
and dealing with _shared assumptions_ between CPU and GPU that are often not explicitly encoded and can break correctness in subtle ways.

#paragraph[Separated Memories]
The CPU and GPU are physically distinct devices with separate memories.
Data can either be transferred explicitly or implicitly between these memories.
To enable implicit data transfers, CUDA 6 introduced CUDA Unified Memory that unifies the virtual address spaces of CPU and GPU pointers.
Multiple studies have investigated the performance of CUDA Unified Memory #cite(label("DBLP:journals/tjs/KnapC19")) #cite(label("DBLP:conf/ccgrid/LiJCS15")) #cite(label("DBLP:conf/hpec/LandaverdeZCH14")) and found that it can result in performance overheads (and sometimes performance benefits) depending on the application's memory access patterns.
Controlling data transfers explicitly remains an important and widely used method until today.
We are focusing on modelling explicit memory transfers in this paper, adding implicit memory transfers to #Descend is left for future work.

When transferring data between the CPU and GPU explicitly, a _host_ thread that is running on the CPU uses an API to initiate the memory transfer.
The host program only accesses CPU memory, while a GPU program only accesses its various GPU memories.
Programmers are responsible for keeping track of which pointers point into the CPU or GPU memory.
This makes it easy for programmers to make mistakes that are not caught by the compiler, such as misusing the provided API for copying data to the GPU:
#cudaCode(numbering: false, ```cpp
cudaMemcpy(d_vec, h_vec, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
```)
#v(1em)

#parIndent Function `cudaMemcpy` copies `size` many bytes to the destination in the first argument from the source in the second argument.
The last argument specifies whether the destination and source are on the device or host.
In the above call, destination and source pointers are swapped, which leads to the address in the host pointer being used to access memory on the device, with undefined behavior.
In #Descend, reference types carry additional information and correct usage is strictly enforced.
Making the same mistake as above, leads to a compile-time error message:
#descendCode(```rust
error: mismatched types
  | copy_mem_to_host(d_vec, h_vec);
  |                  ^^^^^ expected reference to `gpu.global`, found reference to `cpu.mem`
```)
#v(1em)

#parIndent In CUDA, without using Unified Memory, special allocation APIs, or a CUDA-aware allocator in the operating system, it is possible to allocate memory in CPU memory and pass the CPU pointer to the GPU.
The GPU kernel may then accidentally attempt to access CPU memory directly, as in the following code:
#cudaCode(```cpp
void host_fun() { double *vec = malloc(sizeof(double) * N * N);  init_kernel<<<N, N>>>(vec); }
__global__ void init_kernel(double *vec) { vec[globalIdx.x] = 1.0; }
```)
#v(1em)

#parIndent In this example, the host allocates space for an array in the CPU main memory and passes the resulting pointer to the GPU.
The GPU program then attempts to initialize the memory, but it has no access to the separated main memory, leading to undefined behavior.
With full support of CUDA Unified Memory, this program is well-defined, as the GPU would directly access the CPU main memory, resulting in an implicit memory transfer.
%
In the initial version of #Descend, a program such as this would be rejected by the compiler because it recognizes that we are attempting to access CPU memory on the GPU.
The equivalent Descend program fails like this:
#descendCode(```rust
error: cannot dereference `*vec` pointing to `cpu.mem`
  |  (*vec)[[thread]] = 1.0
  |   ^^^^ dereferencing pointer $\texttt{in}$ `cpu.mem' memory --------------------
  |    sched(X) thread in grid.to_threads {
  |             ^^^^^^ executed by `gpu.Thread`
```)
#v(1em)

#parIndent In @sec:descend, we introduce _execution resources_ that identify _who_ executes a piece of code with a focus on the GPU.
However, these also extend to CPU threads.
The formal type system, introduced in @sec:descend-types, extends references with _memory annotations_  that strictly enforce that memory is only dereferenced in the correct execution context.

#paragraph[Shared Assumptions between CPU and GPU]
In CUDA---and #{Descend}---when launching a function on the GPU, the host thread specifies the launch configuration, i.e., the number of threads executing the kernel and their grouping into blocks.
For GPU functions, there are often implicit assumptions about the number of threads that are going to execute the function as well as the amount of memory that is allocated via the host's memory API.
But these assumptions are easily violated on either the CPU or GPU side, such as for this GPU function scaling a vector:
#cudaCode(numbering: false, ```cpp
__global__ scale_vec_kernel(double *vec) { vec[globalIdx.x] = vec[globalIdx.x] * 3.0; }
```)
#v(1em)

#parIndent Each GPU thread accesses a single element of the vector at its index within the entire grid.
The assumption made here, is that the grid contains as many threads as there are elements in the vector.
For example, the following launch of the GPU function from the CPU is erroneous:
#cudaCode(```cpp
cudaMalloc(&d_ptr, SIZE);
...
scale_vec_kernel<<<1, SIZE>>>(d_ptr);
```)
#v(1em)

#parIndent Instead of starting as many threads as there are vector elements, the function is executed by as many threads as there are _bytes_ in the vector.
By launching the GPU function with more threads than vector elements, out-of-bounds memory accesses are triggered.
In #Descend, calling a GPU program with the wrong number of threads leads to an error message at compile time:
#descendCode(```rust
error: mismatched types
  |  scale_vec<<<X<1>, X<SIZE>>>>(d_vec);
  |                               ^^^^^ expected `[f64; SIZE]`, found `[f64; ELEMS]`
```)
#v(1em)

#parIndent We will see in @sec:descend, that all functions are annotated with an execution resource describing how the function expects to be executed.
This makes assumptions explicit.
The type system, presented in @sec:descend-types, enforces this at compile time.

= Safe GPU programming with #Descend <sec:descend>
In this section, we discuss the technical mechanism that #Descend uses to guarantee memory safety and produce the error messages seen in the previous section.
We first give explanations and intuitions, before we will present the most important aspects of the formal type system of #Descend in @sec:descend-types.
We start by introducing _execution resources_, _place expressions_, and _views_ as the central ingredients to formally reason about the execution and memory hierarchy, and to check that parallel memory accesses are performed safely.

== Execution Resources
As shown in the previous section, the correctness of a GPU program often depends on the specific grid of blocks and threads that executes it.
Depending on the number of threads that the kernel is executed with, a memory location may or may not be accessed by multiple threads at the same time, memory accesses may go out-of-bounds or the kernel may simply not compute a complete result.
Furthermore, some instructions are required to be executed by specific sets of threads.
For example, the barrier `__syncthreads` must be executed by all threads within a block, and the warp-shuffle instruction `__shufl_sync` that moves values between threads without using slow global or shared memory, must be executed by a subset of threads within the same warp.

In traditional GPU languages, the grid is specified when the GPU kernel is executed.
The kernel itself has no static knowledge about the grid and can only dynamically refer to its dimensions or blocks and threads.
In addition, a kernel is often not safe for many possible configurations of grids.

To enable reasoning statically about the execution of GPU functions, #Descend introduces _execution resources_, which represent groupings of blocks and threads.
The type system uses execution resources to track whether values are owned or instructions are executed by the entire grid, specific blocks, warps or individual threads.
For this, we need to be able to syntactically compare execution resources, which is the reason to define them with a formal syntax.

#let xy(x, y) = $#`xy`#sym.angle.l#x, #y#sym.angle.r$

#paragraph[Formal Syntax of Execution Resources]
@syn:execs shows the formal grammar of execution resources.
Identifiers are abstract execution resources.
The execution resource `cpu.thread` represents a single thread on the CPU.
The `gpu.grid` stores two _dimensions_ $d$ that describe the up to three-dimensional shape of the blocks.
The size of a dimension is represented as a natural number $eta$ that can either be a constant, a variable, or simple mathematical expressions over natural numbers.
For example, a two-dimensional grid that consists of $2 times 2$ blocks, where each block consist of $4 times 4$ threads, is represented as: $#`gpu.grid`#sym.angle.l #xy(2, 2), #xy(4,4) #sym.angle.r$.
To refer to all blocks of the grid we write:
$
  #`gpu.grid`#sym.angle.l #xy(2,2), #xy(4, 4)#sym.angle.r#`.blocks`#sym.angle.l#`all;` #`xy`#sym.angle.l [0..2], [0..2] #sym.angle.r #sym.angle.r
$
In case we select everything, we use a simplified notation: $e.#`blocks` = e.#`blocks`#sym.angle.l#`all;` #`xy`#sym.angle.l [..][..] #sym.angle.r#sym.angle.r$.

Analogously, we refer to collections of threads or a one-dimensional collection of warps (which in-turn consist of a one-dimensional collection of threads).
Using the _conditional selection_, we represent when only a subset of threads (or blocks, or warps) has been selected based on a runtime condition.
This is important when detecting if a synchronization is safe or might lead to a deadlock.

Using _forall_, we quantify over a dimension, representing, e.g., a slice of blocks sharing the same index in one dimension.
In a naive matrix-multiplication implementation, each row of blocks within the grid takes ownership over all the rows of the output matrix for which the block's threads compute a result.
In order to express this, we need a way of referring to each row of blocks separately. 
Each row of blocks is represented by quantifying over the `y`-dimension of blocks:
$
  #`gpu.grid`#sym.angle.l #xy(2,2), #xy(4,4)#sym.angle.r#`.blocks.forall(y)`
$

Lastly, the _sub-selection_ operator changes the amount of selected sub-execution resources in a given dimension.
This is useful in many scenarios.
For example, to perform a reduction in a single block, some data is accumulated iteratively.
With each iteration, the number of threads performing accumulations is halved.
This means that only a subset of threads within the block is active, which we can represent as: $#`block` [0..(4\/2^i)]_#`x`$ where $i$ is the iteration index.

With _execution resources_ we have a simple yet powerful formal way of referring to collections of blocks and threads within a multidimensional grid.
Next, we have a look at how execution resources are managed in #Descend.

#paragraph[Scheduling over Execution Resources]
In #Descend execution resources are not specified freely anywhere in the program.
Instead, users schedule computations over every dimension of the highest level in the execution hierarchy.
In the following example code, we execute a function with a two-dimensional GPU grid of $2 times 2$ blocks, each comprised of $4 times 4$ threads.

#descendCode(```rust
fn f(...) -[grid: gpu.Grid<XY<2,2>,XY<4,4>>]-> (){
  sched(Y) blockRow in grid.blocks {
    sched(X) block in blockRow {
      split(Y) block.threads at 1 {
        fstThreadGroup => ... 
        sndThreadGroup => ... } } } }
```)
#v(1em)

#parIndent Here, `grid` is the execution resource that executes function `f`.
The type annotation in line 1 specifies the shape of the grid.
The body of the function is executed by the function's execution resource, so in this case, the entire grid.
In line 2, we _schedule_ the nested computation over all groups of blocks in the grid with the same `y`-dimension (rows of blocks).
For that we specify the execution resource to schedule over (`grid.blocks`) and provide an identifier (`blockRow`) to refer to the sub-execution resources.
#Descend requires scheduling over the outer hierarchy levels completely before further scheduling computations within the inner levels.
This means, that rows of blocks are not allowed to schedule computations over threads.
Instead, a row of blocks must schedule the following computations over all blocks in the `x`-dimension.
The scheduled identifier `block` is equivalent to execution resource $#`gpu.grid`#sym.angle.l#xy(2,2),#xy(4,4)#sym.angle.r#`.forall(y).forall(x)`$.
Only when scheduling computations within a single block are we allowed to refer to the threads in the block.
In line 4, each block splits the collection of its threads into two execution resources at index $1$ along the `y`-dimension.
`fstThreadGroup` contains all threads with a thread index less than $1$ in `y`-dimension.
`sndThreadGroup` contains the rest.
The identifier `fstThreadGroup`, is equivalent to the following execution resource:
$
  #`gpu.grid`#sym.angle.l#xy(2,2),#xy(4,4)#sym.angle.r#`.blocks.forall(y).forall(x).threads` [0..1]_#`y`
$

The execution resources introduced here have three main purposes:
_1)_ they are used to checking what code is executed on the CPU and GPU;
_2)_ they are used to checking which instructions are executed by which part of the GPU hierarchy, such as barrier synchronization must be executed inside a block;
_3)_ they keep track of dimensions and sizes that are used in the code generation.

== Place Expressions and Views <sec:place-expressions>
To reason about memory locations and safe memory accesses we define _Place Expressions_ and _Views_.

        }
      )
    )
  }
) <syn:pl-expr>

#paragraph[Place Expressions]
Rust introduces the concept of a _place expression_ as unique names for a memory object.
Aliases are resolved by substituting the referenced place expressions.
This allows them to be compared syntactically in Rust's type system to ensure that the same memory location is not (mutably) accessed simultaneously.
This guarantees data race freedom.

@syn:pl-expr shows #Descend's place expressions.
The simplest place expression is a variable naming a region of memory.
Projections `.fst` or `.snd` are applied to tuples referring to two non-overlapping regions of memory.
The dereference-operator accesses the memory that a reference refers to.
Single elements of an array are accessed by indexing.
These place expressions exist in Rust as well.

In #Descend, we introduce two additional place expressions: #emph[select]s and #emph[view]s.
The select expression $p bracket.l.double e#`.forall`\(d) bracket.r.double$ distributes the ownership of elements within the array place expression $p$ over each sub-execution resource in dimension $d$.
This requires the execution resource (e.g., block) to consists of as many sub-execution resources (e.g., threads) as there are elements in the array.
Each sub-execution resource takes ownership over one element, ensuring a safe concurrent array access.

However, assigning ownership of single array elements to execution resources is very restricting.
In practice, it is often required to take ownership over multiple array elements with a single thread.
Similarly, the first element of an array would always be mapped to the first sub-execution resource.
We require a way of reshaping which sub-execution resource takes ownership over which elements.
To increase the flexibility of safe parallel memory accesses #Descend introduces _views_.

#paragraph[Views]
By applying a view $v$ to an array place expression $p$ with $p.v$, the underlying array is reshaped.
The result of applying a view to an array is a view-array.
View-arrays are very similar to ordinary arrays, but they are not guaranteed to be contiguous in memory.
The reason for this is, that reshaping and reordering is not performed directly in memory.
Instead, accesses to the resulting view-array are being transformed to create the impression of accessing data that has been reshaped and reordered in memory, while in fact, the original array's memory is being accessed.
The memory layout of the original array remains the same.
When generating code, views are compiled into indices following a process similar to the one taken in the Lift compiler~#cite(label("DBLP:conf/cgo/SteuwerRD17")) and DPIA~#cite(label("DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1710-08332")).

@syn:pl-expr shows the basic views in #Descend, which can be combined to express more complex array accesses.
View `group` combines consecutive array elements into nested arrays of a given size.
This enables assigning ownership of groups of elements to an execution resource by using the select operator.
All groups must have the same size by requiring that  the group size perfectly divides the array size.
`take_left` splits the array into two non-overlapping partial arrays at a given position and returns its left-hand side, while `take_right` returns the right-hand side of the split.
We ensure that the position of the split is within the size of the input array.
These views enable programmers to select only a part of an array to work on and do something else with the other part or discard it.
View `transpose` transposes a two-dimensional array and `reverse` reverses the order of elements.
Finally, `map` applies a view to each element of a multidimensional array.

) <fig:upsweep>

@fig:upsweep, shows an example of how views are used to control which thread in a block takes ownership over array elements during the upsweep phase of a work-efficient block-wide scan algorithm.
The code on the left shows an implementation of the upsweep phase in #Descend.
The graphic on the right shows the individual loop iterations from the bottom to the top. 
The dark shaded areas show which array elements each thread has access to in each iteration.
The arrows depict the data flow of the computation showing that each thread only performs reads and writes within the section of the array they have exclusive access to.

In each iteration, the number of active threads is halved using the `split` construct in line 3.
Each active thread is assigned a group of elements using the `group` view in line 6.
The size of the group increases with each iteration.
Two elements are added, and the last owned element is overwritten with the result (lines 7--9).
In between each iteration a synchronization is required (line 2) as we perform the writes to a shared array and change the memory access pattern in each iteration.

This example shows, how views are used to distribute ownership of array elements over many threads, while guaranteeing that there is a clear separation of elements between execution resources.
We can give this guarantee, because all views either group, remove or permute elements of an array and select always assigns threads to distinct elements.
However, redistributing elements that were already distributed previously, may still introduce the possibility of multiple execution resources sharing ownership of elements.
In order to guarantee that no memory location can be (mutably) accessed by more than one thread at the same time, we must guarantee that two place expressions aren't aliases for the same memory locations.
In Rust, this guarantee is achieved through borrow checking.
In #Descend, we have extended borrow checking to guarantee alias freedom between memory accessed by different execution resources.

== Extended borrow checking in #Descend
Rust uses _ownership_, _borrowing_, and _lifetimes_ to statically guarantee that there are no data races, memory leaks, use-after-free errors and other memory related errors.
Ownership ensures that there is no aliasing of memory objects, as on assignment to a new variable the value can only be accessed via the new variable.
Attempts to access memory via the old variable lead to compile-time errors.

As ownership alone is too restrictive, with borrowing, a restricted notion of aliasing is reintroduced into the language.
The _borrow checker_ checks if a thread is allowed to create a (unique or shared) reference to a memory object, i.e., "borrow" it.
Multiple shared references can be used at the same time, for reading only.
A unique reference, guarantees that there are no other ways to access the same memory location.
It is, therefore, safe to mutate the underlying memory.

Finally, lifetimes ensure that the underlying memory of a reference hasn't been deallocated.
Attempting to dereference when the memory might have been freed results in a compiler error.

#paragraph[#Descend's extended borrow checker]
On the CPU, #Descend implements the same rules as Rust.
On the GPU side, the ownership, and borrowing rules are extended and diverge from Rust.
In Rust, ownership always belongs to a single thread.
In #Descend, each execution resource, such as the grid or a block might take ownership of a memory object or create references, i.e., they might borrow.
This means that collections of blocks or threads, as well as single threads, own and borrow memory objects, formally represented as place expressions.
For a single thread to be able to write into a memory location by having exclusive access to it, the ownership and borrows must be _narrowed_ using #Descend's hierarchical scheduling, selections and views.

_Narrowing_ describes how ownership and borrows are refined when navigating the execution hierarchy from grid, to blocks and threads.
For example, the ownership of an array by a grid is narrowed to the grid's blocks by the blocks collectively borrowing the array, each block a distinct part.
This might be further narrowed to the block's threads.
But narrowing can be violated:
#descendCode(```rust
fn kernel(arr: &uniq gpu.global [f32; 1024]) -[grd: gpu.Grid<X<32>,X<32>>]-> () {
  sched(X) block in grd {
    let in_borrow = &uniq *arr; // Narrowing violated
    sched(X) thread in block {
      let group = &uniq arr.group::<32>[[thread]]; // Narrowing violated
      arr.group::<32>[[block]][[thread]]; } } }
```)#v(1em)

#parIndent In the example, the parameter `arr` is owned by the grid.
Attempting to borrow `arr` in line 3 _after_ having scheduled the blocks of the grid violates narrowing, because each block in the grid would get unique write access to the entire array.

Another narrowing violation is shown in line 5.
The array is grouped so that there are as many groups as threads per block.
Then each thread selects a group and borrows that group uniquely.
However, the same selection is performed for each block, because there was no selection for `block`.
Therefore, threads from different blocks would gain access to the same memory location.

Line 6 shows correct narrowing.
The array is grouped, and each block exclusively borrows a part of the array, before each thread in each block selects an element from it.

#paragraph[Synchronization]
#Descend's narrowing ensures that no two threads have mutable access to the same memory location.
However, sometimes we do want to communicate with another thread via shared memory and then the other thread must be able to access the same memory location as well.
We, therefore, need a way to allow an subsequent access by another thread while guaranteeing that this access cannot lead to a data race.
By synchronizing threads at a barrier, we get the guarantee that all memory accesses before the barrier cannot conflict with memory accesses after the barrier.

== Shared Write Access through Atomics <subsec:atomics>
Up until this point, we have explained how #Descend enforces that two threads cannot (mutably) perform write access to the same memory location.
However, this requirement is often too strict.
Some applications, such as histograms, require threads to update memory locations concurrently.
This is achieved without race conditions by using atomic read-modify-write (RMW) operations.

#Descend supports a limited form of RMW operations via atomic types that resemble the atomic types in Rust:
RMW operations are performed on values with atomic types that are referred to by shared references.
This allows multiple threads to perform RMW operations through the same reference, without violating the extended borrow checking rules.
For example, operation `atomic_fetch_add_u32` has the following function signature:
#descendCode(numbering: false, ```rust
atomic_fetch_add_u32<r:prv, m:mem>(atom_ref:&r shrd m AtomicU32, val:u32) -[t:gpu.Thread]-> u32
```)#v(1em)

#parIndent The function takes two arguments: a shared reference to a memory location and a value to add to the memory location.
It must be called by a single thread and returns the value stored at the memory location before performing the RMW.

In the current version of #Descend RMW operations are performed with a relaxed memory ordering, which does not impose constraints on other reads and writes.
Implementations that require a more sophisticated use of atomics must resort to unsafe #Descend code, possibly using inlined CUDA code.
In future work, we would like to investigate weak memory models and other memory orderings such as sequential consistency and acquire-release.

== Escaping Restrictions Using Unsafe <subsec:unsafe>
For some algorithms, there is no statically known partitioning of the memory that #Descend's views can express.
Even when views can be used to express the general access pattern, indices and natural numbers must be statically guaranteed to be within array bounds or fulfill constraints such as a size being dividable by a specific number, e.g., the size of a `group` view must divide the size of the grouped array.
This can be a problem for such algorithms, for example for graph algorithms, where the nodes are often stored linearly in memory and referred to with an index that is read from memory or computed at runtime, depending on the shape of the graph.

#Descend offers programmers a way to escape these restrictions, enabling them to write programs that would otherwise not be expressible in #Descend -- at the cost of introducing unsafe blocks of code.
Preceding an expression with `unsafe` tells the type checker to not perform extended borrow checking as well as constraint checks.
For example, an optimized implementation of the Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) algorithm for GPU, chooses edges to process at runtime.
After choosing the edge, the index of the edge's destination node `dst` is read from memory and then the array `node_data` containing the data for all the graph's nodes is accessed as follows:
#descendCode(numbering: false, ```rust
unsafe &shrd (*(*graph).node_data)[dst]
```)#v(1em)

#parIndent Without `unsafe` the above line would not type check, as `dst` is not known statically when checking that the index is within the range of the array.
The SSSP implementation uses a highly optimized worklist to track nodes whose distances must be (re-)computed.
To avoid data races on this worklist while still being efficient, the implementation utilizes CUDA's weak memory model. 
This use of atomics goes beyond what can currently be expressed in safe #Descend.
Using `unsafe` we can write inline CUDA code to call directly into the existing worklist CUDA library.
`Unsafe` code lacks the strong safety guarantees and must be used with caution, but it greatly increases the usefulness of #Descend while we gradually work on increasing the expressiveness of safe code.

== Handling Separated Memories in #Descend <subsubsec:mem-and-borrow>
#paragraph[Tracking Memory Spaces]
#Descend annotates all reference types with _address spaces_.
This is similarly done in CUDA, but CUDA does not have an address space for CPU pointers and generally does not strictly enforce their correct use.
In #Descend, the `cpu.mem` address space comprises values stored in the CPU stack and heap.
For the GPU, we differentiate between the global `gpu.global`, shared memories `gpu.shared` and thread local memories `gpu.local`, which have separate address spaces.
Using execution resources, #Descend enforces that references are only dereferenced in the correct execution context, such as preventing dereferencing a GPU reference on the CPU.
#Descend also supports polymorphism over memory spaces, by introducing a type-level variable $m$ that is used in place for a concrete address space.

#paragraph[Allocating Memory]
Dynamic memory allocations, i.e., allocations on the CPU heap and in global GPU memory, are managed via unique smart pointers to ensure that they are freed safely without leaking memory.
We call their types \@-types, as they carry an annotation _at_ which address space they have been allocated.
The memory is freed when the smart pointer is destroyed at the end of a scope.
Therefore, our type `T @ cpu.mem` corresponds to `Box<T>` in Rust.
The following code shows how memory is allocated and initialized:
#descendCode(```rust
{ let cpu_array: [i32,n] @ cpu.mem = CpuHeap::new([0;n]);
  { let global_array: [i32;n] @ gpu.global = GpuGlobal::alloc_copy(&cpu_array);
  } // free global_array
} // free heap_array
```)#v(1em)

#parIndent In the outer block, heap memory is allocated and initialized with an array of size `n` filled with $0$.
The smart pointer that manages the allocation is then stored in variable `cpu_array`.
In the inner block, GPU global memory is allocated for the data pointed to by `heap_array`, the data is copied to the GPU and the resulting smart pointer is stored in `global_array`.
The type annotations shown here are optional, but show the information stored in the type.

== Making Implicit Assumptions Explicit in #Descend <subsubsec:exec-gpu-program>
The CPU program is responsible for scheduling a GPU function for execution.
In #Descend, this is a special function call, as in CUDA, where not just the function arguments are provided, but also the executing GPU grid is specified; here comprising 32 blocks with 32 threads each:
#descendCode(numbering: false, ```rust
scale_vec::<<<X<32>, X<32>>>>(&uniq vec);
```)#v(1em)

#parIndent In contrast to CUDA, in #Descend, the GPU function signature carries the information on which grid configuration is allowed to execute the function:
#descendCode(numbering: false, ```rust
fn scale_vec(vec: &uniq gpu.global [i32; 1024]) -[grid: gpu.grid<X<32>, X<32>>]-> ();
```)#v(1em)

#parIndent #Descend checks that the call site and the function declaration matches, to ensure that the assumptions about how the function is written and how it is invoked do not diverge.
#Descend also supports polymorphism over grid sizes, allowing GPU functions to be written that, for example, launch as many threads as the size of the input array.
In this case, the call site specifies the concrete values that are used for instantiating the grid size variables.

The CPU thread waits for the GPU function call to finish, meaning there is an implicit synchronization of the GPU grid at the end of each GPU computation.

In this section, we present the formal foundations of #Descend, including the syntax of terms and types, and the most important typing rules, explaining the formal reasoning behind ensuring safety.
Our type system is based on the formalization of Rust's type system in Oxide~#cite(label("DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1903-00982")).
A technical report with the full type system of #Descend is available at https://descend-lang.org.
